= rust coredump tests

This repo has a test program that's used to compare the behavior of the https://crates.io/crates/coredump[coredump] crate with the built in `panic = abort` behavior.  The program itself sets up some configuration as requested and then panics.  There's a wrapper script `run_all.sh` that runs all combinations of configuration:

* `panic = abort` or `panic = unwind` (see https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#panic[Cargo's panic configuration])
* use the coredump crate (true/false)
* whether the program tries to catch the panic (true/false)

In all cases we set RUST_BACKTRACE=full to show the full stack trace.

== Summary of results

Notes:

* In all configurations, the stack trace is pretty-printed before the process dumps core.
* In all of the core files generated, `foo` and `bar` appear on the stack (i.e., in no case was the stack unwound before generating the core file).
* The only difference observed between `panic=abort` and enabling the `coredump` crate is which signal terminated the process.  `coredump` did not allow a panic to be caught.  Note that in these tests, `ulimit -c` was already set to `unlimited`.  The "coredump" crate does reconfigure this to enable core files, so this would be a difference in other environments.
* In the integration test version, the panic cannot be caught if _either_ `panic = abort` or the "coredump" crate is enabled, even though the former did not result in generating a core file.
* In the integration test version, `panic = abort` has no effect.  This is mostly as documented, although as of this writing it's unclear if this is supposed to be altered by https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64158#issuecomment-672098008[panic-abort-tests] (which we do use below).
